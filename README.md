# Web 3.0 Roulette

## Setup

This project uses `yarn` for dependency management, `nvm` for version management and node 18.16.0, so make sure you have those running in your terminal. If that is not the case, run the following commands to setup your environment (for information on how to install `nvm` click [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)):

```
nvm install 18.16.0     // to install 18.16.0
nvm use 18.16.0         // to use 18.16.0
npm install -g yarn     // to install yarn globally
```

After setting the node version, some setup is needed before running the app. For specific documentation for each app read the following documents:

- [Smart Contract](./docs/truffle-app.md)
- [Node.js API](./docs/node-app.md)
- [React Application](./docs/react-app.md)

Finally, start the react and node apps using the following commands:

- `npm run start-react-app` to run the react app
- `npm run start-node-app` to run the node app

This workspace has been generated by [Nx](https://nx.dev) so you can run different commands to interact with the apps in the project. You can install [Nx Console](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nrwl.angular-console&utm_source=nx-project) in VSCode to easily access Nx commands directly in your code editor.

- `npx nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of the projects
- `npx nx serve react-app` to run the react app
- `npx nx serve node-app` to run the node app


## Deploy to Heroku

Deployment is not automated. To publish changes, commit them to a branch, then push them to Git and run the command `git push heroku branch_name:main`. Ensure that the Heroku remote exists; if it does not exist, run `heroku git:remote -a app-name` beforehand.
