# Web 3.0 Roulette

## Setup

This project uses `yarn` for dependency management, `nvm` for version management and node 18.16.0, so make sure you have those running in your terminal. If that is not the case, run the following commands to setup your environment (for information on how to install `nvm` click [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)):

```
nvm install 18.16.0     // to install 18.16.0
nvm use 18.16.0         // to use 18.16.0
npm install -g yarn     // to install yarn globally
```

Now you just have to run `yarn install` and you will be ready to test and develop all the apps in the project.

This workspace has been generated by [Nx](https://nx.dev) so you can run the following commands to interact with the apps in the project:

- `npx nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of the projects
- `npx serve react-app` to run the react app
- `npx serve node-app` to run the node app

You can also install [Nx Console](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=nrwl.angular-console&utm_source=nx-project) in VSCode to easily access Nx commands directly in your code editor.

For specific documentation for each app read the following documents:
- [Smart Contract](./docs/truffle-app.md)
- [Node.js API](./docs/node-app.md)
